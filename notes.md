## How to Run
  1. Install Node.js (if not already installed).
  2. Install Dependencies:
    - npm install express socket.io
  3. Run the Backend:
    - node server.js

### Deploy Your App Online:
  - Render
  - Railway
  - Glitch
  - Vercel (frontend only; backend needs a different service)

### Use a Cloud Provider
  - AWS
  - Google Cloud
  - Azure

### Info
  - Netlify alone cannot directly host your backend.
  - youâ€™ll need to host your backend separately (e.g., on Render, Railway, or Heroku)
  - 
  - GitHub alone cannot host both the frontend and backend directly for a live
  - 
  - Yes, you can use Netlify for hosting your frontend and Firebase for your backend. Firebase provides an easy-to-use backend with features like a real-time database, Firestore, and hosting for serverless functions. Here's how you can set it up:

### Install Firebase
  - npm install -g firebase-tools
  - firebase login
  - firebase init hosting
